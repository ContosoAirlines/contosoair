# Microsoft Demo

Demo website application for Contoso Air.  
Runs a nodejs server (Express v4.16) that stores customer booked flights in a CosmosDb database.

## Requirements

* Node v8.9.4 or later
* Azure CosmosDb

## Local Environment Setup

This project uses ES6, and has been tested with nodejs v8.9.4  
There is almost no front-end logic. Still, the application uses webpack to compile sass styles and bundle third parties js files. If you want to modify any front logic or style run `npm run local:build`.

In order to launch a local server on port 3000 (can be modified with environment variable PORT) run:

```bash
npm install
SET %COSMOS_DB_NAME%=<azure_web_site>
SET %COSMOS_DB_AUTH_KEY%=<cosmos_auth_key>
npm start
```

This will run locally the server and attach to the CosmosDb Endpoint using mongodb connection string.

## Azure Manual Deployment

In order to create the Azure deploy there is an ARM template located at deployment folder.

ARM template parameter | Usage | e.g.
--- | --- | ---
p_environment | set an environment suffix | `dev`
p_site_prefix | common prefix for all resources created | `contoso-air`
p_site_web_name | website specific resource name | `web`
p_comosdb_name | database specific resource name | `db`

> e.g. previous parameter examples will create resources `contoso-air-db-dev` and `contoso-air-db-dev`.

Then you run the ARM template with the following commands ([Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) required): 

```bash
cd deployment
az group deployment create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --template-file azuredeploy.json --parameters p_environment=dev
```

What's left is to compress the whole folder in a zip file and upload it to Azure. Manually it can be done going to [https://<app_service_resource>.scm.azurewebsites.net/ZipDeployUI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-nodejs#deploy-zip-file)

> Note: Files under folders `deployment`, `scss` and files `front.js` and `webpack.config.js` are not required to be zipped.
